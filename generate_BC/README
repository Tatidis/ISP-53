The BC file's columns correspond to:
FLMV is the main flow venturi for the inlet flow rate measurement (kg/s)
KWTS the total power injected in ALL the heated rods in (kW)
KWSHRD the total power injected in the heaters of the flow housing in (kW)
PRBTC sensor for the outlet absolute pressure measurement (kPa)
TFLOW the thermocouple for the inlet water temperature measurement in (C)
TFSC1 the thermocouple of the water at the begining of the heated length (C)
TSHROUD the thermocouple of the shroud at the middle of the heated length (C). Note the thermocouples didn't work for B0-XX-YY experiments and a 300C uniform value should be set.

The order is the following:
TIME    FLMV    KWTS    KWSHRD  PRBTC   TFLOW   TFSC1   TSHROUD
